### Acknowledgement
I would like to Thank couple of my acquaintance,
- Aarif for... well his domain was in Melanoma Detection and Segmentation, and he said he couldn't really help me without actually 
working on the data. So he didn't really help me, but I would like to Thank him anyway for taking time of his busy 
schedule and talking to me.
- Sharwon for... well providing me with moral support?, by saying things like 'Well, be yourself' and 'It's gonna be fine'. It sounds wierd but 
it kinda calmed me down and let me work on my project. He said those words for my 'interview' with you though, but I would like
to still Thank him here.

And finally, I would like to Thank all of you from AI Without Borders for giving me this project. This was really, really fun!
